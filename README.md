# Good-and-Bad-Customers-for-Granting-Credit

# Aim : 
The banks with the intent of credit card were more focused on the number of customers using their credit service but the drawback of them not being able to pay back the credit in time was an issue that soon followed, a system was in need to effectively decide the credit limit to be allowed to a person based on his previous credit history. You will learn how to apply Logistic Regression to credibility of the customer. Also learn how to evaluate Logistic Regression model using various parameter like on Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity and area under the ROC curve.  Build a classification model using logistic regression to predict the credibility of the customer, in order to minimize the risk and maximize the profit of a bank.

Evaluation Parameters 
Evaluation will be based on: 
•	Data Preparation 
•	Model Comparison 
•	Model Selection 

# Data Preparation 
Analyze the data statistically and treat the multicollinear variables.
 
# Model Comparison 
Apply logistic regression algorithms for every change made in the datasets and compare results. 

# Model Selection 
Select the best model. Model selection to be based on Accuracy, Sensitivity & Specificity and area under the ROC curve. 

# Expected Outcome 
Higher accuracy in predicting the outcome using test data.
